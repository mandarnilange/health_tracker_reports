# Health Tracker Reports – Current Implementation Plan

Last reviewed: 2025-10-18

This document reflects the **implemented** architecture, dependencies, and open follow‑ups for the Health Tracker Reports application. Earlier drafts that referenced ML Kit pipelines, embedding matchers, or large local NER models have been archived.

## Product Vision

A privacy-first Flutter app that lets people capture or upload their lab reports, extract biomarker values with high accuracy using cloud LLMs, log daily vital signs, view unified health timeline, track trends across both lab results and vitals, and prepare shareable summaries.

---

## Core Requirements (Delivered vs Pending)

- **Implemented**
  - Upload PDF/image reports and run a cloud LLM extraction pass.
  - Persist reports locally in Hive.
  - View, filter, and sort saved reports.
  - Track biomarker trends across reports.
  - Manage LLM provider selection and API keys in Settings.
  - Riverpod-based state management, GetIt/Injectable DI.
  - Unit + widget test coverage for critical flows.

- **Planned / Not Implemented**
- **Phase 6**: Daily health tracking (vitals logging, unified timeline view). _Domain entities & use cases in progress._
  - **Phase 5**: Doctor PDF generation, CSV export, Google Drive sync.
  - **Phase 4 Hardening**: Image file loading in `ImageProcessingService._readImageBytes`.
  - **Phase 4 Hardening**: Provider parity tests (OpenAI/Gemini services).
  - Local notifications, reminders, onboarding refinements.

## Extraction Pipeline (Implemented)

1. **Image preparation**
   - PDFs rendered page-by-page to PNG via `pdfx`.
   - Non-PDF images intended to be read by `ImageProcessingService.imageToBase64` (current stub).
   - Optional compression keeps payloads <5 MB.

2. **LLM inference**
   - `LlmExtractionRepositoryImpl` selects the configured provider (Claude, OpenAI, Gemini).
   - Each provider service (Dio-based) receives a base64 image + normalization hints.
   - Prompt instructs the model to return canonical biomarker JSON with metadata.

3. **Report synthesis**
   - `ExtractReportFromFileLlm` converts LLM results into domain `Report`/`Biomarker` entities.
   - Normalization relies on provider output plus any existing names fetched from Hive.

4. **Persistence**
   - `SaveReport` assigns IDs with `uuid` and persists via `ReportRepositoryImpl` (Hive).
   - Config updates flow through `ConfigRepositoryImpl`.

5. **Presentation**
   - Upload and Review pages use Riverpod `ExtractionNotifier` + `ReportsNotifier`.
   - Trends page consumes `GetBiomarkerTrend`, `CalculateTrend`, `CompareBiomarkerAcrossReports`.

---

## Key Modules

- **Domain**
  - Entities: `Report`, `Biomarker`, `HealthLog`, `VitalMeasurement`, `ReferenceRange`, `TrendDataPoint`, `AppConfig`, `LlmExtractionResult`.
  - Repositories: `ReportRepository`, `HealthLogRepository`, `TimelineRepository`, `ConfigRepository`, `LlmExtractionRepository`.
  - Use cases: `ExtractReportFromFileLlm`, `CreateHealthLog`, `GetUnifiedTimeline`, `GetVitalTrend`,
    `SaveReport`, `GetAllReports`, `DeleteReport`, `GetBiomarkerTrend`, `CalculateTrend`,
    `CompareBiomarkerAcrossReports`, `NormalizeBiomarkerName`, `SearchBiomarkers`, `UpdateConfig`.

- **Data**
  - Local: `HiveDatabase`, `ReportLocalDataSource`, `HealthLogLocalDataSource`, `ConfigLocalDataSource`.
  - External: `ImageProcessingService`, `Claude/OpenAi/GeminiLlmService`.
  - Repositories: `ReportRepositoryImpl`, `HealthLogRepositoryImpl`, `TimelineRepositoryImpl`,
    `ConfigRepositoryImpl`, `LlmExtractionRepositoryImpl`.

- **Presentation**
  - Providers: `reports_provider.dart`, `health_log_provider.dart`, `timeline_provider.dart`,
    `extraction_provider.dart`, `config_provider.dart`, `trend_provider.dart`, `vital_trend_provider.dart`.
  - Pages: Upload, Review, Trends, Settings (API key management), Report detail, Health log entry (bottom sheet),
    Health log detail, Reminders (stub), Export (placeholder), Onboarding (basic).
  - Widgets: `HealthTimeline`, `HealthLogCard`, `BiomarkerCard`, `VitalInputField`, `VitalTrendChart`.

---

## Testing Overview

- Unit tests cover:
  - Domain entities and trend calculations.
  - Report/config repositories with Hive boxes (mocked).
  - LLM provider service parsing (Claude).
  - Providers and notifiers.

- Widget tests cover:
  - Upload, Review, Trends, Report detail, Router, core widgets.

The pipeline currently lacks integration tests for OpenAI/Gemini parsing and real image IO.

## Known Gaps / TODO

| Area | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Image file loading | ❌ | `_readImageBytes` is unimplemented; local image uploads fail. |
| API key security | ✅ | API keys persisted via `flutter_secure_storage`; Hive now stores sanitized placeholders only. |
| Provider parity tests | ⚠️ | Only Claude service has unit tests; OpenAI/Gemini missing. |
| Normalization strategy | ⚠️ | LLM prompts accept hints, but `NormalizeBiomarkerName` is still used in trend use cases. Decide whether to keep or remove. |
| Legacy constants | ⚠️ | `core/constants/model_config.dart` references deprecated ML models. |
| Export/Doctor PDF | ❌ | Not implemented; presentation/pages/export contains stubs. |
| Notifications/Reminders | ⚠️ | Pages exist but functionality incomplete. |

---

## Risks & Mitigations

- **API Keys in Hive**  
  Keys are currently persisted in plain Hive boxes. Mitigation: implement secure storage (platform keychain/keystore) and document migration.

- **Unimplemented Image IO**  
  Image uploads from camera/gallery will throw at runtime. Mitigation: finish `_readImageBytes` and cover with widget/integration tests.

- **LLM Error Handling Coverage**  
  Only limited provider tests exist. Mitigation: add tests for OpenAI/Gemini parsing, error branches, and cancellation.

- **Legacy Files**  
  Old ML artifacts can mislead future updates. Mitigation: clean up unused constants or tag them clearly as deprecated.

## Phase Checklist (High-Level)

| Phase | Focus | Status | Notes |
|-------|-------|--------|-------|
| Phase 1 – Upload & Extraction | LLM-based upload flow, Hive persistence, settings | ✅ Core flows implemented |
| Phase 2 – Viewing & Trends | Reports list, trends, search/filter | ✅ Implemented with Riverpod and charts |
| Phase 3 – Enhancements | Reminders, onboarding | ⏳ Partially done (reminders stubbed) |
| Phase 4 – LLM Extraction | Dynamic normalization, UI polish, secure storage | ✅ Complete (hardening tasks pending) |
| **Phase 6 – Daily Health Tracking** | **Vitals logging, unified timeline, vital trends** | 🚧 **In progress (domain foundations complete)** |
| Phase 5 – Export & Sharing | Doctor PDF, CSV export, Drive sync, sharing | ❌ Not started |

**Phase 4 Hardening (Pending)**:
- Image file loading (`_readImageBytes`)
- Provider coverage tests (OpenAI/Gemini)
- Regression fixtures (multi-page PDF + image tests)

**Next Priority**: Phase 6 – Daily Health Tracking (spec file created: `spec/phase-6-daily-health-tracking.md`)

## Working Agreements

- Maintain TDD cadence: write/extend tests before altering production logic.
- Update `/spec` alongside feature changes; flag TODOs explicitly.
- Keep changelog entries truthful to the repository history (instructions per user request).
- Use conventional commits and update coverage metrics regularly (`flutter test --coverage`).
