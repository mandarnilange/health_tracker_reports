## API Key in URL

**Vulnerability:** Insecure Data Handling
**Severity:** High
**Location:** lib/data/datasources/external/gemini_llm_service.dart:29
**Line Content:** `'$_baseUrl/models/$_model:generateContent?key=$apiKey'`
**Description:** The API key is passed as a query parameter in the URL. This is insecure because the API key can be logged in server logs, browser history, and other places. 
**Recommendation:** Pass the API key in the request header, for example, in the `Authorization` header as a bearer token.

## Information Disclosure in Error Handling

**Vulnerability:** Information Disclosure
**Severity:** Low
**Location:** lib/app.dart:78
**Line Content:** `Text(error.toString(), ...)`
**Description:** The application displays the result of `error.toString()` directly to the user when the configuration fails to load. While the current implementation only seems to throw `Failure` objects which do not contain sensitive information in their `toString()` method, this is a fragile design. If any other part of the application throws a different type of error, it could be caught by this handler and its string representation (which might contain a stack trace or other sensitive details) could be displayed to the user.
**Recommendation:** Replace `error.toString()` with a generic, user-friendly error message. Log the full error details to a secure, developer-only logging system for debugging purposes. For example, you could display a message like 'Failed to load configuration. Please try again later.' to the user, while logging the actual `error.toString()` and stack trace for developers to analyze.

## Information Disclosure in ServerException

**Vulnerability:** Information Disclosure
**Severity:** Low
**Location:** lib/core/error/exceptions.dart:69
**Line Content:** `String toString() => statusCode != null ? 'ServerException ($statusCode): $message' : 'ServerException: $message';`
**Description:** The `toString()` method of the `ServerException` class includes the HTTP status code and the error message. If this exception is not caught and handled properly, it could be caught by a generic error handler and displayed to the user, which could leak information about the server's internal state.
**Recommendation:** Avoid including sensitive information in the `toString()` method of exceptions. Instead, provide a generic error message and log the detailed error information for developers.

## Information Disclosure in Failure Messages

**Vulnerability:** Information Disclosure
**Severity:** Low
**Location:** lib/core/error/failures.dart:108, lib/core/error/failures.dart:121, lib/data/datasources/external/share_service.dart:22
**Line Content:** `const ApiKeyMissingFailure(this.provider) : super('API key required for $provider');`, `const RateLimitFailure(this.retryAfter) : super('Rate limit exceeded. Retry after $retryAfter');`, and `return Left(ShareFailure(message: e.toString()));`
**Description:** The `ApiKeyMissingFailure`, `RateLimitFailure`, and `ShareFailure` classes include potentially sensitive information in their messages, which are displayed to the user. This can leak information about the application's state and configuration.
**Recommendation:** Instead of displaying the raw error message from the `Failure` objects, map them to user-friendly error messages in the UI. For example, when an `ApiKeyMissingFailure` occurs, the UI should guide the user to the settings page to enter their API key. When a `RateLimitFailure` occurs, the UI should inform the user to try again later. For `ShareFailure`, a generic message like "Failed to share file" should be displayed.

## Potential Prompt Injection

**Vulnerability:** Prompt Injection
**Severity:** Low
**Location:** lib/data/datasources/external/claude_llm_service.dart:57, lib/data/datasources/external/gemini_llm_service.dart:41, lib/data/datasources/external/openai_llm_service.dart:47
**Line Content:** `'text': _getPrompt(existingBiomarkerNames),`
**Description:** The `_getPrompt` method in `claude_llm_service.dart`, `gemini_llm_service.dart`, and `openai_llm_service.dart` constructs a prompt that includes `existingBiomarkerNames`. These names are retrieved from the database and are not sanitized before being included in the prompt. A malicious user could potentially craft a report with specially crafted biomarker names that could be used to manipulate the LLM's behavior.
**Recommendation:** While the risk is low, it is a good practice to sanitize the `existingBiomarkerNames` before including them in the prompt. For example, you could escape any special characters that could be interpreted by the LLM.

## Information Disclosure in File System Error Handling

**Vulnerability:** Information Disclosure
**Severity:** Low
**Location:** lib/data/datasources/external/file_writer_service.dart:217, lib/data/datasources/external/pdf_generator_service.dart:106
**Line Content:** `message: 'File system error: ${exception.message}',` and `message: 'Failed to generate PDF: ${e.toString()}',`
**Description:** The `_mapFileSystemException` method in `file_writer_service.dart` and the `generatePdf` method in `pdf_generator_service.dart` include the original exception message in the `FileSystemFailure` message. This failure is then displayed to the user in a `SnackBar`. This could leak sensitive information about the file system, such as file paths or other details.
**Recommendation:** Replace the detailed error message with a generic, user-friendly error message. Log the full error details to a secure, developer-only logging system for debugging purposes.
